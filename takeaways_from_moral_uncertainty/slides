1. Introduction

Caveat: **Personal** takeaways

Neither intended as nor successful at being
a summary of the book

Book [Ord, MacAskill & Bykvist 2020]

Available online!

2. Why

Society's moral beliefs change over time

Other smart, informed people have wildly
different moral beliefs

Our moral beliefs change over time

→ We ought to be *very* morally uncertain

3. Why Not

Intertheoretical comparisons impossible!

Answer: variance voting
[Cotton-Barratt 2013]

Also, not always incomparable

Meta-ethical regress!

Answer: Fixed point solutions (maybe)
[Tarsney 2019], [Trammell 2019]

Fanaticism!

Answer: ¯\_(•_•)_/¯

Maybe fanaticism isn't so bad?
[Wilkinson 2020]

Non-cognitivist objections!

Answer: Some very complicated proposals,
e.g. ecumenical non-cognitivism

Also ¯\_(•_•)_/¯

4. How

Borda count for ordinal theories

Variance voting for cardinal theories

Maximize expected choiceworthiness

Example

CANDO

5. So What

Lesson 1: Let's not die

If you die, you loose all possibility
of making further moral progress

Lesson 2: Let's not use control

* Malthusian state
* Global dictatorship
* Extinction
* Other species (including AI)

Lesson 2: This might be practically relevant
(Like, in everyday life)

I've had at least one situation where this
was practically relevant

Lesson 3: Might change efforts

Focussing on more deontologically/contractually
motivated interventions (sometimes)

Example: Voting & encouraging others to vote
Motivated by contractualism
