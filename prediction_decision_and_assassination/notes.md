Prediction, Decision and Assassination: Using Markets to Determine Truth
========================================================================

Problem: This is getting very extensive, maybe two talks: 1 about
prediction and forecasting in general, and one about prediction markets?

Introduction
------------

### Question for the Audience

How many people already know about prediction/decision/assassination
markets?

### Epistemic Status

Not an economist, not a professional forecaster, doing it as a hobby
for ~1 year.

Bragging about personal accuracy at the end.

### Assumptions

* Beliefs about the world are probabilistic in nature.
* It is possible and productive to assign probabilities to events.
* It is possible to improve at forecasting.

The last statement is testable.

Nobody can predict the future, but we're getting better at it.

Explanations
------------

### Prediction Markets

#### Example

Think betting, but more rigorous.

• Alice wants to know whether there will be a drought in summer 2020
• She wants to plant chrysanthemes
• But: not a meteorologist, and no time for in-depth research
• She decides to make a market: "Will there be a drought in summer 2020?"
• She makes a market on an online platform, and puts 10$ into the pool
• Bob is a meteorologist, and decides he is confident enough to buy 10 shares for 1$ each on "no"
• Christine is less confident, and buys only 2 shares for "yes"
• More people follow
• Market closes on March 1st, 32 shares bought by 4 for "no", 12 for "yes" by 3
• Alice plants her chrysanthemes
• In autumn 2020, her flowers are alive and well
• She pays out 48 shares to the 4 "no" betters

#### General Sequence of Events

* Definition of resolution criteria
* Open the market
* Market stabilizes
* Time of decision -> decision is made based on the market information
* Market is closed
* Time of resolution
* Distribute money

### Decision Markets

### Assassination Markets

Concepts
--------

### Calibration

### Score

#### Log Score

TODO: Formula

#### Brier Score

`$score=\frac{1}{N}*\sum_{i=1}^{N} (o_{i}-f_{i})^2$`

#### Binary vs. Numeric Questions

#### Prediction Markets vs. Prediction Platforms

Prediction markets: Participants invest money and effort and
get results.

Examples:

* PredictIt
* Augur

Prediction platforms: Participants are intrinsically motivated and
__want__ to make accurate predictions. Possibly gamified with points.

* Metaculus
* Predictionbook
* Foretold

Problems
--------

### Not Perfect

Only aggregate available information.

Prediction markets may be more accurate than individuals or other
institutions, but they can only aggregate available information (under
the same constraint as anybody else).

→ Sorry, take your travelling salesmen somewhere else.

### General Problems

#### Markets may not be Efficient

#### Unclear Resolution Criteria

#### Limited Horizons

There are time horizons involved here: It seems hard to make markets care
about what is going to happen after their participants die.

→ Mostly even less than that: ~20 years seems a maximum of what people
can be motivated to care about.

But: Intrinsic motivation to be correct about the far future may be a
remedy (prediction __platforms__ vs. prediction __markets__).

Applications
------------

### Predicting the Future

Generally anything where one wants to have a more accurate picture of
facts about the future.

Examples:

* Development of clean meat timelines
* time until AGI
* probability of risks from pandemics

Much, much more.

### Settling Conflicts
