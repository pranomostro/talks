Dear friends of effective altruism,

this mail is a follow-up to the workshop at the meetup last month, where
you were asked to make forecasts and submit them. Now the time has come
to evaluate your forecasts!

First the results! The teams had the following scores:

Group 1:

Brier score: 0.1435277
Linear scoring rule for intervals: 0.0700983

Group 2:

Brier score: 0.1216451
Linear scoring rule for intervals: 0.40082375

Group 3:

Brier score: 0.236965
Linear scoring rule for intervals: 0.3398795

Group 4:

Brier score: 0.1951944
Linear scoring rule for intervals: 0.1062106

Lower scores are better.

Note that the results are probably unreliable since the sample sizes are
quite small, and at least one question was designed to give an unfair
advantage to some people (as well as some submissions being incomplete).

The results to the forecasts were gathered on 2020-06-15 20:00,
and the forecasts were graded using both the brier score and the
linear scoring rule for prediction intervals described in [Greenberg
2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07501). I used the base-10 logarithm as
constant (since some of you showed great interest in forecasting scoring
rules, that paper might be worth a look â€“ I found it interesting). For
the interval scoring rule, I computed the mean of scores on all interval
questions.

If you want to revisit the talk, my slides are available
[here](https://github.com/pranomostro/talks/blob/master/quantitative_forecasting/slides.pdf).
If you want to continue forecasting, the two main alternatives
are [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/) and
[GJOpen](https://www.gjopen.com/), two very active internet communities.

The standard recommended book is
[Superforecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superforecasting:_The_Art_and_Science_of_Prediction)
by Philip Tetlock, although I haven't read it.

If you would like to have the code and/or data I used to score the
forecasts, just email me: adrian.regenfuss@posteo.de. Similar if you
are not sure which group you were in.

I hope you enjoyed this exercise, and took a little bit away from it.

See you soon,

Adrian
